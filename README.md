## Idea and Directory Structure
We have two folder named as front for frontend(client side) & back for backend(server side).

## How to run this project

### `npm run start`

## But before this you need to run this command.

### `npm i`

# DON'T FORGET TO RUN `npm i` FOR BOTH THE FOLDERS.

After setting up all these open up the back folder and create a `.env` file in that particular directory. Change the MONGODB_URL, PORT & JWT_SECRET(optional) to see the working of the Mongodb Database.

# Now you are good to go!!
